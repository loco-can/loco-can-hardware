# Version 3.x
*in early development state*

The new version 3.x marks the switch from the Atmega MCUs to the ESP32 series from the Chinese manufacturer Espressif. In addition to integrated Bluetooth and WiFi functionality, the CAN controller is also already built in, making the modules even smaller.

The first module is a complete 4-quadrant motor driver for 80 amps motor current, which can be operated directly on the CAN bus.

Version 3.x is fully compatible with all other versions.
